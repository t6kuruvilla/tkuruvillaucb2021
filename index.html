  <p>The FIFA World Cup often called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930. 1942 and 1946 did not hold it because of the Second World War.<p>
    <p>The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.<p>
    <p>The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month.<p>
    As of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, twenty-one final tournaments have been held, and 79 national teams have competed. Eight national teams have won the trophy. Brazil has won five times, and they are the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, France, and inaugural winner Uruguay, with two titles each; and England and Spain, with one title each.
    <p>The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world, as well as the most widely viewed and followed single sporting event in the world. The cumulative viewership of all matches of the 2006 men's World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final game, a ninth of the entire population of the planet.<p>
    <p>Seventeen countries have hosted the World Cup. Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each hosted twice. In contrast, Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, Japan, South Korea (jointly), South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar will host the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, making Mexico the first country to host games in three World Cups.</p>

    <p style="font-size:18px">We are a team of 'Futbol' Aficionados that loves the sport. 
      'Futbol' is the most popular sport worldwide, continuing to develop in the USA. 
      The FIFA World Cup is taking place in 2022, between November 21 and December 18, in Qatar. 
      We thought it would be fun and interesting for "Futbol" aficionados (and non aficionados looking to learn more) to have a tool that allows exploring the story of previous world cups. 
      Our tool has five different areas:<p>
    <ul> 
      <li style="font-size:18px"><b>History:</b> In this section, we explore the countries that have won the world cup between 1930 and 2018 while analyzing goals and games played and the winning percentage by country.</li>
      <li style="font-size:18px"><b>World Cup and FIFA Ranking:</b> In this segment, we focus on exploring which FIFA confederation and country has the best overall performance within each World Cup. This section is divided into four areas plus the landing page. We explored ways to present the information where 'Futbol' Aficionados can have fun seeing how countries and confederations Race to the top. The 'Race to the Top' tab refreshes their memory about each World Cup from 1930 to 2018. In the 'Brief World Cup History' tab, where we used a scrolling page to present the information. Do you remember who was the top scorer in Argentina in 1978?</li>
      <li style="font-size:18px"><b>The Penalty Shootout Corner:</b> Many people consider the penalty shootout to be a pure coin toss exercise, but we aim to explore potential differences in performance among countries which suggests skills and other circumstances may influence the outcome going beyond pure luck.</li>
      <li style="font-size:18px"><b>World Cup 2018 – Deep Dive:</b> As 'Fultbo aficionados' are getting ready for the 2022 World Cup, we thought it would be helpful to dive deeply into the 2018 World Cup. Here, we explore the top teams and players' statistics. We use bubble charts to compare teams and players across the different stages of the world cup, and we provide a heat map of key statistics for 2018 matches.</li>
      <li style="font-size:18px"><b>World Cup 2022:</b> Finally, we provide a quick visualization for all qualified teams. We look forward to seeing how our teams - "Team USA," Germany, and Mexico - perform this time.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p style="font-size:18px">We hope "Futbol Aficionados" worldwide enjoy our tool, remember key facts about the World Cups and find new fun insights. Do you remember who played in the final in Spain in 1982? Which FIFA confederation has had the best performance? Are African and Asia's countries improving?</p>
